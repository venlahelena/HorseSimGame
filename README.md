**Manage, Breed, and Train Your Own Horses in a Living Valley**

Stabelworks is a realistic horse breeding and stable management simulation game built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Manage your horsesâ€™ genetics, health, training, and career progression while contributing to restoring a neglected valley through quests, competitions, and strategic stable management.

## Project Overview

- Own and care for multiple horses, each with unique genetics and personalities
- Breed horses using Mendelian inheritance rules for coat colors, markings, and stats
- Maintain health, mood, and training schedules for optimal performance
- Compete in races, show jumping, and dressage events
- Complete quests to restore a struggling valley, unlocking new facilities and rare resources
- Progress from a novice breeder to a skilled stable manager with a thriving valley

## Current Status
